        <div class="section__eyebrow">Why ResetHaven was built</div>
        <h2 class="section__title">Most systems fail at the exact moment people need them most</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p class="card__body">
          Many self-improvement systems assume stable energy, clear thinking,
          and consistent motivation. In reality, those are often the first things to disappear
          during periods of stress, overwhelm, or transition.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          ResetHaven was designed from the opposite direction: for moments when attention is fragmented,
          energy is limited, and decision-fatigue is high.
          When everything feels urgent, the system slows the environment down and
          makes the next step obvious.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          The goal is not rapid transformation.
          The goal is regaining enough stability that momentum can quietly rebuild—without collapse,
          guilt, or constant restarting.
