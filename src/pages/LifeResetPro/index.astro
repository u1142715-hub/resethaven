          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Is this meant to be intense or time-consuming?</summary>
          <p>
            No. The guiding principle is “small enough to do today.” The system prioritises stabilisation, clarity, and finishable steps over long routines.

        <details>
          <summary>What if I’m already overwhelmed and can’t focus?</summary>

            That’s the use case. The approach is designed to reduce decision-fatigue and make the next step obvious, so you can move forward without needing a burst of motivation.

        <details>

            No. This is a practical self-management system to support daily structure and follow-through. If you need professional care or crisis support, seek local services.
